# native-chatApp

## Intro
#### native-chatApp has been made purely with JavaScript and the React-Native framework of JS.
#### It has a google firebase connection. Login with email and password is available.
#### The way to started with this is fork this repo and then use `git clone https://github.com/KlassiC-Man/native-chatApp.git` to get started, next use `cd chatApp` and then start with the coding part!
#### NPM or YARN should be installed along with nodejs so as to allow you to run the code.

## Running the Code
#### Running the code is simple inside of your terminal just type `npm start` and it will open the metro bundler in your browser.
#### IN the metro bundler select if you want to test it on an android device or iOS device emulator or if on a physical device scan the QR Code in the bundler.
#### The expo go app is a must to scan the QR and begin testing
#### And that should fire it up for you!!!!

## Changing it into your App and **Not** Mine
#### To start turning it into your app just change the firebase config and database into your own firebase app otherwise it wont allow you to run please make sure to do that!
#### The firebase.js file contains code which runs my app not the one you desire to make!
#### If you dont know what is firebase but want to get started here is your [link](https://firebase.google.com)
