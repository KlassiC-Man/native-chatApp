# native-chatApp

## Intro
##### native-chatApp has been made purely with JavaScript and the React-Native framework of JS.
##### It has a google firebase connection. Login with email and password is available.
##### The way to get started with this is, is to fork this repo and then use `git clone https://github.com/nothingButSyntaxError/native-chatApp.git` , next use `cd chatApp` and then start with the coding part!
##### NPM or YARN is mandatory to be installed along with nodejs so as to allow you to run the code.

## Running the Code
##### Running the code is simple inside of your terminal just type `npm start` and it will open the metro bundler in your browser.
##### In the metro bundler select if you want to test it on an android device or iOS device emulator or if on a physical device scan the QR Code in the bundler.
##### The expo go app is a must to scan the QR and begin testing
##### And that should fire it up for you!!!!

## Changing it into your App and **Not** Mine
##### To start turning it into your app, change the firebase config and database into your own firebase app otherwise it wont allow you to run please make sure to do that!
##### The firebase.js file contains code which runs my app not the one you desire to make!
##### If you dont know what is firebase and want to know more about it, here is your [link](https://firebase.google.com)
